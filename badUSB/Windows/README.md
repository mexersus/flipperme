Because getting on your wifi is the start of things.  

- Upload the script to your badusb folder on the flipper  

- Connect flipper to a windows PC  

- Make sure you have a uploader running on a server  
  You can use this golang server : [postServer i have prepared](https://github.com/mexersus/flipperme/tree/main/linux/golang/postServer)
